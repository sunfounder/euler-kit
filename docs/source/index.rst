SunFounder Euler Ultimate Kit for Raspberry Pi Pico
===========================================================

Thank you for choosing the SunFounder Euler Kit

This is an advanced learning kit based on the Raspberry Pi Pico. It contains a variety of components, including displays, sounds, drivers, controllers and sensors, which allows you to gain a comprehensive understanding of electronic devices.

For you, we have prepared a number of interesting and useful projects as well as a great deal of relevant and authoritative information. All you need to do is turn on your computer, and you can learn programming in no time at all.

Additionally, we offer three programming languages. MicroPython, C/C++ (Arduino) and Piper Make are all available. To help you get started quickly, each language has targeted and interesting projects, so you can pick one that meets your needs.

Please feel free to e-mail us if you are interested in learning other projects we don't have. We will update our online tutorials as soon as possible.

Here is the email: cs@sunfounder.com.


**About the display language**

In addition to English, we are working on other languages for this course. Please contact service@sunfounder.com if you are interested in helping, and we will give you a free product in return. 
In the meantime, we recommend using Google Translate to convert English to the language you want to see.

The steps are as follows.

* In this course page, right-click and select **Translate to xx**. If the current language is not what you want, you can change it later.
