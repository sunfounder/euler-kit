2.6 - Tilt ItÔºÅ
==========================

|img_tilt|

The tilt switch is a 2-pin device with a metal ball in the middle. When you put it upright, the 2 pins are connected together; when you tilt the switch, 2 pins will be disconnected.


**Schematic**

|sch_tilt|

When you put it upright, GP14 will get high; after tilting it, GP14 will get low.

The purpose of the 10K resistor is to keep the GP14 in a stable low state when the tilt switch is in a tilted state.
