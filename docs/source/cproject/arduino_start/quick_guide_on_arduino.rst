1.4 Quick Guide on Arduino
==========================


In the next projects, 
the code section tells you which code is used, 
so you can open them by going to the ``euler-kit/arduino/`` path and 
double-clicking on the ``.ino`` file with the serial number. 

But first you need to do: 

    * :ref:`setup_pico_arduino`
    * Make sure you have downloaded the package and uploaded the library by referring to :ref:`add_libraries_ar`.
