.. note::
    
    This step is very important and only necessary for the first use on the Arduino IDE, otherwise your code will upload unsuccessfully.
    
    After the upload is successful this time, Pico will be recognized by the computer as COMxx (Raspberry Pi Pico).

    You only need to plug it into the computer the next time you use it.

7. After the  **Done Uploading** appear, you will see the LED on the Pico blinking.
