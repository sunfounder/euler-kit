6.1 - Measuring Distance
======================================

The ultrasonic sensor module works on the principle of sonar and radar systems for determining the distance to an object.

Once the program is running, the Serial Monitor will print out the distance of the ultrasonic sensor from the obstacle ahead.


**How it works?**

About the application of ultrasonic sensor, we can directly check the
subfunction.

.. code-block:: arduino

    float readSensorData(){// ...}

``PING`` is triggered by a HIGH pulse of 2 or more microseconds. (Give a
short ``LOW`` pulse beforehand to ensure a clean ``HIGH`` pulse.)

.. code-block:: arduino

    digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW); 
    delayMicroseconds(2);
    digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH); 
    delayMicroseconds(10);
    digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW); 

The echo pin is used to read signal from PING, a ``HIGH`` pulse whose
duration is the time (in microseconds) from the sending of the ping to
the reception of echo of the object.

.. code-block:: arduino

    microsecond=pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);

The speed of sound is 340 m/s or 29 microseconds per centimeter.

This gives the distance travelled by the ping, outbound and return, so
we divide by 2 to get the distance of the obstacle.

.. code-block:: arduino

    float distance = microsecond / 29.00 / 2;  


Note that the ultrasonic sensor will pause the program when it is working, which may cause some lagging when writing complex projects.
