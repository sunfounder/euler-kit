2.3 Service Bell
==========================

For this project we used a microswitch and an active buzzer to create a service bell. Tap the switch and the buzzer makes a sound.

Micro Switch is also a 3-pin device, the sequence of the 3 pins are C (common pin), NO (normally open) and NC (normally closed).

When the micro switch is not pressed, 1 (C) and 3 (NC) are connected together, when pressed 1 (C) and 2 (NO) are connected together.

**Wiring**

* By default, pins 1 and 3 of the Micro Switch are connected together and GP14 is low. When the Micro Switch is pressed, GP14 is high.
* GP15 outputs high to make the buzzer sound.
