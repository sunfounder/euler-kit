I2C LCD1602
==============

液晶显示器（LCD）是一种平板显示器或其他电子调节光学装置使用的光调制特性的液晶与组合偏振器。液晶不直接发光，而是使用背光或反射器来产生彩色或单色图像。

LCD 的应用范围很广，包括LCD 电视、计算机显示器、仪表板、飞机驾驶舱显示器以及室内和室外标牌。
小型 LCD 在便携式消费设备中很常见，例如数码相机、手表、数字时钟、计算器和移动电话，包括智能手机。
LCD 屏幕还用于消费电子产品，例如 DVD 播放器、视频游戏设备和时钟。


LCD1602 is a character type liquid crystal display, which can display 32 (16*2) characters at the same time.

**I2C communication**

As we all know, though LCD and some other displays greatly enrich the man-machine interaction, they share a common weakness. When they are connected to a controller, multiple IOs will be occupied of the controller which has no so many outer ports. Also it restricts other functions of the controller. Therefore, LCD1602 with an I2C bus is developed to solve the problem.


I2C(Inter-Integrated Circuit) bus is a very popular and powerful bus for communication between a master device (or master devices) and a single or multiple slave devices.
I2C main controller can be used to control IO expander, various sensors, EEPROM, ADC/DAC and so on. All of these are controlled only by the two pins of host, the serial data (SDA1) line and the serial clock line(SCL1).
