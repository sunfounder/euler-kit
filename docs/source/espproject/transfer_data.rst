1.3 What Data is Transferred between APP & Pico？
===================================================

#. From APP to Pico

    Let's take a look at what kind of data Pico will get from the APP. Print ``data`` directly in ``on_receive``.

    .. note::

        * Open the ``1.3_ws_test_print.py`` file under the path of ``euler-kit\esp8266`` or copy this code into Thonny, then click "Run Current Script" or simply press F5 to run it.
        * Don't forget to click on the "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)" interpreter in the bottom right corner. 

    * For detailed tutorials, please refer to :ref:`open_run_code_py`.
        * Each time you rerun the code, you need to connect your device's Wi-Fi to ``my_esp8266``, then turn on SunFounder Controller and reconnect.


    .. code-block:: python
        :emphasize-lines: 21,22

        from ws import WS_Server
        import json
        import time

        NAME = 'my_esp8266'

        ## Client Mode
        # WIFI_MODE = "sta"
        # SSID = "YOUR SSID HERE"
        # PASSWORD = "YOUR PASSWORD HERE"

        ## AP Mode
        WIFI_MODE = "ap"
        SSID = ""
        PASSWORD = "12345678"


        ws = WS_Server(name=NAME, mode=WIFI_MODE, ssid=SSID, password=PASSWORD)
        ws.start()

        def on_receive(data):
            print(data)

            # output

            # input

        ws.on_receive = on_receive

        def main():
            print("start")
            while True:
                ws.loop()

        main()

    You will see the data for each area in the Shell. When we drag the Slider in the H area, the value of the H area will change. This is because we only add one control widget (H area). The widget in the G area is not used for control but only for show.


    |sc_ws_test_data|


    We can also add other control widgets, and use the same method to view the values ​​sent by these widgets to Pico.

    You can get the value of the corresponding widget by just using the label. As shown below, print the value of the H widget:

    .. note::

        * Open the ``1.3_ws_test_print_h.py`` file under the path of ``euler-kit\esp8266`` or copy this code into Thonny, then click "Run Current Script" or simply press F5 to run it.
        * Don't forget to click on the "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)" interpreter in the bottom right corner. 

    * For detailed tutorials, please refer to :ref:`open_run_code_py`.
        * Each time you rerun the code, you need to connect your device's Wi-Fi to ``my_esp8266``, then turn on SunFounder Controller and reconnect.

        SSID = ""
        PASSWORD = "12345678"


        ws = WS_Server(name=NAME, mode=WIFI_MODE, ssid=SSID, password=PASSWORD)
        ws.start()


        def on_receive(data):
            print(data['H'])

            # output

            # input


        ws.on_receive = on_receive

        def main():
            print("start")
            while True:
                ws.loop()

#. From Pico to APP
    
    Use the ``send_dict`` function to show the value in G Widget.

    .. note::

        * Open the ``1.3_ws_test_input.py`` file under the path of ``euler-kit\esp8266`` or copy this code into Thonny, then click "Run Current Script" or simply press F5 to run it.
        * Don't forget to click on the "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)" interpreter in the bottom right corner.

        from ws import WS_Server
        import json
        import time

        NAME = 'my_esp8266'

        ## Client Mode
        # WIFI_MODE = "sta"
        # SSID = "YOUR SSID HERE"
        # PASSWORD = "YOUR PASSWORD HERE"

        ## AP Mode
        WIFI_MODE = "ap"
        SSID = ""
        PASSWORD = "12345678"


        ws = WS_Server(name=NAME, mode=WIFI_MODE, ssid=SSID, password=PASSWORD)
        ws.start()

        led = machine.PWM(machine.Pin(15))
        led.freq(1000)
        potentiometer = machine.ADC(28)

        def on_receive(data):

            # output

            # input
            value=potentiometer.read_u16()
            ws.send_dict['G'] = value # the value show on the G area


        ws.on_receive = on_receive

        def main():
            print("start")
            while True:
                ws.loop()

        main()

    After running the code, turn the potentiometer and you will be able to see the value of the G widget change.
