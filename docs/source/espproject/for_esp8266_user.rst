Play Pico with APP 
================================================


This section will guide you through building a remote project using the Sunfounder Controller APP, which means you can use your phone/tablet to control your circuit.

This play is based on micropython and it is recommended to do it after completing the micropython tutorial.


The ESP8266 module provides wifi functionality for the pico, and they communicate with each other via the uart protocol.

Here are some examples that teach you how to implement communication between Raspberry Pi Pico and SunFounder Controller, as well as some interesting projects.
