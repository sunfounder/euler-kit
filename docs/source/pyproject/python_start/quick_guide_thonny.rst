1.5 Quick Guide on Thonny
==================================

.. _open_run_code_py:

Open and Run Code Directly
---------------------------------------------

In the next projects, the code section tells you which code is used, so you can open them by going to the ``euler-kit/micropython/`` path and double-clicking on the ``.py`` file with the serial number. 

But first you need to make sure you have downloaded the package and uploaded the library by referring to :ref:`download_upload`.

#. Open Code

    For example, ``2.1_hello_led.py``.

    Double click on it and it will appear in a new window on the right, you can also open multiple codes at the same time.

    |mps_open_code|

#. Select Correct Interpreter

    Plug the Pico into your computer with a micro USB cable and select the "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)" interpreter in the bottom right corner.

    |mps_sec_inter|

#. Run the Code

    Click the **Run current script** button or just press F5 to run it.

    |mps_run_it|

    If there is information in the code that needs to be printed, it will appear in the Shell; otherwise, only the following information will appear.

    If the Shell window does not appear on your Thonny, you can click **View** -> **Edit** to open it.

        .. code-block::

            MicroPython v1.17 on 2021-09-02; Raspberry Pi Pico with RP2040

            Type "help()" for more information.
            >>> %Run -c $EDITOR_CONTENT

    * The first line prompts for the MicroPython version, the date, and your device information.
    * The second line suggests that you can type "help()" to get some help.
    * The third line is an instruction from Thonny telling the MicroPython interpreter on your Pico to run the contents of the script area - the 'EDITOR_CONTENT'. 
    * If there are any messages after the third line, they are usually the message you told MicroPython to print, or the error messages for the code.




#. Stop Running

    |mps_stop_it|

    Click the **Stop/Restart backend** button to stop the running code. After stopping, the ``%RUN -c $EDITOR_CONTENT`` in the shell will disappear.

#. Save or Save as

    If you make changes to the open example, you can press ``Ctrl+S`` or click the **Save** button on Thonny to save it.

    If you want to save this code as a separate file inside the Raspberry Pi Pico, click **File** -> **Save As**.

    |mps_save_as|

    Select **Raspberry Pi Pico**.

    |mps_sec_pico|

    Then enter the file name and the extension ``.py``, and then click **OK**. You will then see your saved file on the Raspberry Pi Pico drive.

    |mps_sec_name|

    .. note::
        You can save your code under any name, but it’s best to describe what kind of code it is, and don’t name it with meaningless names such as ``abc.py``.
        It is important to note that if you save the code file name as ``main.py``, it will run automatically when the power is turned on.



Create File and Run it
---------------------------


Again, in the code section, we show the code directly and you can copy it to Thonny and run it by the following method.

#. Create a new file

    Open Thonny IDE, click New button to create a new blank file.

    |mps_new_file|

#. Copy Code

    Copy the code from the project to the Thonny IDE.

    |mps_copy_file|

#. Select Correct Interpreter

    Plug the Pico into your computer with a micro USB cable and select the "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)" interpreter in the bottom right corner.

    |mps_sec_inter|

#. Run and Save the Code

    You need click **Run Current Script** or simply press F5 to run it. If your code has not been saved, a window will pop up asking to save to **This computer** or **Raspberry Pi Pico**.

    |mps_where_save|

    .. note::
        When you tell Thonny to save your program on the Raspberry Pi Pico, if you unplug the Pico and plug it into someone else's computer, your program is still saved on the Pico.

    Choose the location you want to save, then enter the file name and the extension ``.py``, and then click OK.

    |mps_sec_name|

    .. note::
        You can save your code under any name, but it’s best to describe what kind of code it is, and don’t name it with meaningless names such as ``abc.py``.
        It is important to note that if you save the code file name as ``main.py``, it will run automatically when the power is turned on.

    When your program is saved, it will run automatically and you will see following information in the Shell area.

    If the Shell window does not appear on your Thonny, you can click **View** -> **Edit** to open it.


    .. code-block::

        MicroPython v1.17 on 2021-09-02; Raspberry Pi Pico with RP2040

        Type "help()" for more information.
        >>> %Run -c $EDITOR_CONTENT


    * The first line prompts for the MicroPython version, the date, and your device information.
    * The second line suggests that you can type "help()" to get some help.
    * The third line is an instruction from Thonny telling the MicroPython interpreter on your Pico to run the contents of the script area - the 'EDITOR_CONTENT'. 
    * If there are any messages after the third line, they are usually the message you told MicroPython to print, or the error messages for the code.


#. Stop Running

    |mps_stop_it|

    Click the **Stop/Restart backend** button to stop the running code. After stopping, the ``%RUN -c $EDITOR_CONTENT`` in the shell will disappear.

#. Open File

    If you want to open your saved code file, there are two ways:

    * The first is to click the open icon in the Thonny toolbar, just like when you save the program, you will be asked whether you want to open from **This Computer** or **Raspberry Pi Pico**, for example, click **Raspberry Pi Pico** and you will see a list of all programs you saved to your Pico. 
    * The second one is to open the files preview directly by clicking **View** -> **Files**->, then double-clicking the corresponding ``.py`` file to open it.
