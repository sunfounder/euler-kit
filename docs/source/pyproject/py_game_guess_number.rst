7.7 Guess Number
==============================



Guessing Numbers is a fun party game where you and 
your friends take turns inputting a number (0~99). 
The range will be smaller with the inputting of 
the number till a player answers the riddle correctly. 
Then the player is defeated and punished. For example, 
if the lucky number is 51 which the players cannot see, 
and the player ① inputs 50, the prompt of number range 
changes to 50~99; if the player ② inputs 70, the range 
of number can be 50~70; if the player ③ inputs 51, 
this player is the unlucky one. Here, we use keypad 
to input numbers and use LCD to output outcomes.


**Schematic**


|sch_guess_number|

This circuit is based on :ref:`py_keypad` with the addition of an I2C LCD1602 to display the pressed keys.


**Wiring**

|wiring_game_guess_number| 

To make the wiring easier, in the above diagram, the column row of the matrix keyboard and the 10K resistors are inserted into the holes where G10 ~ G13 are located at the same time.


**Code**

.. note::

    * Open the ``7.7_game_guess_number.py`` file under the path of ``euler-kit/micropython`` or copy this code into Thonny, then click "Run Current Script" or simply press F5 to run it.

    * Don't forget to click on the "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)" interpreter in the bottom right corner.

* After the code runs, press ``A`` to start the game. A random number ``point`` is produced but not displayed on the LCD, and what you need to do is to guess it. 
* The number you have typed appears at the end of the first line till the final calculation is finished. (Press ``D`` to start the comparation.)
* The number range of ``point`` is displayed on the second line. And you must type the number within the range. 
* When you type a number, the range narrows; if you got the lucky number luckily or unluckily, there will appear ``GAME OVER!``
