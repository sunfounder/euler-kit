7.10 Reversing Aid
======================



In this project, we will use LED, 
buzzer and ultrasonic sensors to make a reverse assist system. 
We can put it on the remote control vehicle to simulate the 
actual process of reversing the car into the garage.

* Once the program is running, the ultrasonic sensor will continuously read the distance to the obstacle in front of you, and you can see the exact distance value from the shell.
* The LED and buzzer will change the frequency of blinking and beeping depending on the distance value, thus indicating the approach of the obstacle.
* In the :ref:`py_ultrasonic` article, we mentioned that the ultrasonic sensor will pause the program when it works.
* Therefore, in this example, we created a separate thread for ranging, so that it does not interfere with the timing of the LED and buzzer.
