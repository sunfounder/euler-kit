2.5 Drum Kit
=============================

For this project, let's make a drum kit with three buttons and a slide switch. Now, play your own drums.

* :ref:`cpn_bb`
* :ref:`cpn_res`
* :ref:`cpn_cap`
* :ref:`cpn_button`
* :ref:`cpn_slide`

**Wiring**

|drum_kit0|

* When the slide switch is toggled to the right, GP12 is high; when toggled to the left, GP12 is low.
* Each of the three buttons is connected to a pull-down resistor, GP13~GP15 are low by default; when the button is pressed, GP13~GP15 are high.


**Code**

.. note::

    * You can refer to the image below to write code by dragging and dropping. 
    * Import ``2.5_drum_kit.png`` from the path of ``euler-kit\piper``. For detailed tutorials, please refer to :ref:`import_code_piper`.

After connecting Pico, click the **Start** button and the code starts to run. Pressing different buttons or toggling the slide switch will produce different drum sounds, just like a drum kit.

.. note::
    If you are using a computer, you will need to plug in headphones or audio to your computer to hear the sound emitted.
