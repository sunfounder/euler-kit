In this step, you need to make sure that your Pico is unplugged from your computer, as it needs to be plugged in in a specific way in the next step. Make sure your cable can handle power and data, as many micro USB cables only have power.

Now, press and hold the RST (white) button on the Pico and plug the Pico into your computer. Once plugged in, you can release the button.

Your Pico will appear as a USB drive, click **Next** after that select **RPI-RP2** drive.
