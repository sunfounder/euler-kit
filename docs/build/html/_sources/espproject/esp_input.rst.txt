#. Create a new controller and add the following widgets.

    |sc_app_display|


#. Run ``1.4_ws_display.py``.

    .. note::

        * Open the ``1.4_ws_display.py`` file under the path of ``euler-kit/esp8266`` or copy this code into Thonny, then click "Run Current Script" or simply press F5 to run it.

        * Don't forget to click on the "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)" interpreter in the bottom right corner. 

    * For detailed tutorials, please refer to :ref:`open_run_code_py`.


#. Each time you rerun the code, you need to connect your device's Wi-Fi to ``my_esp8266``, then turn on SunFounder Controller and reconnect.
#. After clicking the **Run/Stop** button, you can try to press a button or rotate a potentiometer and see how the values of the widgets in area **B** and area **C** on the app change.
