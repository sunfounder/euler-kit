Upload the Libraries to Pico
----------------------------------

#. In some projects, you will need additional libraries. So here we upload these libraries to Raspberry Pi Pico first, and then we can run the code directly later.

#. Click **View** -> **Files** in the top navigation bar of Thonny IDE.

    |mps_th_files|

#. Go to the folder where you downloaded the `code package <https://github.com/sunfounder/euler-kit/archive/refs/heads/main.zip>`_ before, and then go to the ``micropython/`` folder.

    |mps_th_path|

#. Select "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)" from the interpreter selection button in the bottom right corner, but make sure that your Raspberry Pi Pico is connected to your computer via a Micro USB cable.

    |mps_interpreter|

#. The drive **Raspberry Pi Pico/** will appear, and the next step is to upload all the code and library files to it.

    |mps_th_pico|

#. Each project has its own **.py** file with serial numbers. To avoid increasing Pico's usage, only select ``.py`` files and folders without serial numbers.

#. It will take a while for the file to upload after clicking **Upload to**.

    |mps_th_upload|

#. Now you will see the files you just uploaded inside your drive ``Raspberry Pi Pico``.
