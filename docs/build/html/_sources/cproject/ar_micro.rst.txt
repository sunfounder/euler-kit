2.8 - Press Gently
==========================

|img_micro_switch|

Micro Switch is also a 3-pin device, the sequence of the 3 pins are C (common pin), NO (normally open) and NC (normally closed) .

When the micro switch is not pressed, 1 (C) and 3 (NC) are connected together, when pressed 1 (C) and 2 (NO) are connected together.

**Schematic**

|sch_limit_sw|

By default, GP14 is low and when pressed, GP14 is high.

The purpose of the 10K resistor is to keep the GP14 low during pressing.

The 104 ceramic capacitor is used here to eliminate jitter.

After the program runs, when you toggle the slide switch to the right, "The switch works!" will appear in the Serial Monitor.
